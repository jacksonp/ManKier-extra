.SH NAME
.PP
docker\-image\-push \- Push an image or a repository to a registry


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBdocker image push [OPTIONS] NAME[:TAG]\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Use \fB\fCdocker image push\fR to share your images to the Docker Hub
\[la]https://hub.docker.com\[ra]
registry or to a self\-hosted one.

.PP
Refer to \fBdocker\-image\-tag(1)\fP for more information about valid image and tag names.

.PP
Killing the \fBdocker image push\fP process, for example by pressing \fBCTRL\-c\fP while it
is running in a terminal, terminates the push operation.

.PP
Registry credentials are managed by \fBdocker\-login(1)\fP\&.


.SH EXAMPLES
.SH Pushing a new image to a registry
.PP
First save the new image by finding the container ID (using \fBdocker container ls\fP)
and then committing it to a new image name.  Note that only a\-z0\-9\-\_. are
allowed when naming images:

.PP
.RS

.nf
# docker container commit c16378f943fe rhel\-httpd

.fi
.RE

.PP
Now, push the image to the registry using the image ID. In this example the
registry is on host named \fB\fCregistry\-host\fR and listening on port \fB\fC5000\fR\&. To do
this, tag the image with the host name or IP address, and the port of the
registry:

.PP
.RS

.nf
# docker image tag rhel\-httpd registry\-host:5000/myadmin/rhel\-httpd
# docker image push registry\-host:5000/myadmin/rhel\-httpd

.fi
.RE

.PP
Check that this worked by running:

.PP
.RS

.nf
# docker image ls

.fi
.RE

.PP
You should see both \fB\fCrhel\-httpd\fR and \fB\fCregistry\-host:5000/myadmin/rhel\-httpd\fR
listed.
