.SH NAME
.PP
docker\-container\-exec \- Run a command in a running container


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBdocker container exec [OPTIONS] CONTAINER COMMAND [ARG...]\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Run a process in a running container.

.PP
The command started using \fB\fCdocker exec\fR will only run while the container's primary
process (\fB\fCPID 1\fR) is running, and will not be restarted if the container is restarted.

.PP
If the container is paused, then the \fB\fCdocker exec\fR command will wait until the
container is unpaused, and then run


.SH CAPABILITIES
.PP
\fB\fCprivileged\fR gives the process extended
Linux capabilities
\[la]http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html\[ra]
when running in a container.

.PP
Without this flag, the process run by \fB\fCdocker exec\fR in a running container has
the same capabilities as the container, which may be limited. Set
\fB\fC\-\-privileged\fR to give all capabilities to the process.


.SH USER
.PP
\fB\fCuser\fR sets the username or UID used and optionally the groupname or GID for the specified command.

.PP
The followings examples are all valid:
   \-\-user [user | user:group | uid | uid:gid | user:gid | uid:group ]

.PP
Without this argument the command will be run as root in the container.


.SH Exit Status
.PP
The exit code from \fB\fCdocker exec\fR gives information about why the container
failed to exec or why it exited.  When \fB\fCdocker exec\fR exits with a non\-zero code,
the exit codes follow the \fB\fCchroot\fR standard, see below:

.PP
