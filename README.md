# Extra Man Pages for ManKier

The bulk of man pages on [ManKier](https://www.mankier.com/) are built from the packages available in [Fedora Rawhide](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/Rawhide).

This repository contains additional man pages for ManKier, for packages or individual pages not available in Rawhide.

If you’d like to see a package’s man pages added to Mankier, please submit a pull request or open an issue.

If there is a name conflict with an existing man page, use an extension for all pages in the package. E.g. all [openssl](https://www.mankier.com/package/openssl) pages have extension “ssl”.
