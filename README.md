# Extra Man Pages for ManKier

The bulk of man pages on [ManKier](https://www.mankier.com/) are built from the packages available in [Fedora Rawhide](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/releases/rawhide/) and [RPM Fusion](https://rpmfusion.org/).

This repository contains additional man pages for ManKier, for packages or individual pages not available from those repositories.

If you’d like to see a package’s man pages added to Mankier, please submit a pull request following the file structure and yaml configurations in this repo.

If there is a name conflict with an existing man page, use an extension for all pages in the package. E.g. all [openssl](https://www.mankier.com/package/openssl) pages have as extension suffix “ossl”.
