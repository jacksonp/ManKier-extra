.SH NAME
.PP
docker\-image\-rm \- Remove one or more images


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBdocker image rm [OPTIONS] IMAGE [IMAGE...]\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Removes (and un\-tags) one or more images from the host node. If an image has
multiple tags, using this command with the tag as a parameter only removes the
tag. If the tag is the only one for the image, both the image and the tag are
removed.

This does not remove images from a registry. You cannot remove an image of a
running container unless you use the \fB\-f\fP option. To see all images on a host
use the \fBdocker image ls\fP command.
