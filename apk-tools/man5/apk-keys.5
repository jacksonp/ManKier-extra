.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
The \fB/etc/apk/keys\fR directory stores RSA public keys which are trusted by apk
to verify cryptographic signatures for packages.\& To trust a new key, simply add
the armored public key to this directory.\& See \fBabuild-keygen\fR(1) for
information on generating new keys, \fBabuild-sign\fR(1) for using these keys to
sign files, and \fBapk-verify\fR(8) for verifying keys against the apk trust store.\&
