.SH NAME
.P
\fB/etc/apk/world\fR - list of explicitly installed packages
.P
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
At /etc/apk/world, apk maintains the \fIworld\fR, or list of explicitly installed
packages.\& This is a plaintext file with one package spec per line.\&
.P
If you edit this file manually, you should run \fBapk-fix\fR(8) to apply the
changes.\&
.P
.SH PACKAGE SPECIFICATION
.P
Specifying a package name with no other modifiers will install the latest
version of that package from the first repository in which it is available.\&
.P
To pin a package to a tagged repository, use the format \fBpkgname@tagname\fR, e.\&g.\&
\fBbusybox@edge\fR.\& See \fBapk-repositories\fR(5) for details on tagged package
repositories.\&
.P
To constrain the acceptable versions of the package, use the \fB=\fR, \fB<\fR, \fB>\fR,
\fB>=\fR, or \fB~=\fR operators.\& Respectively, these require the package is equal to,
less than, greater than, or greater than or equal to the specified version.\& The
\fB~=\fR operator constrains the package to the version numbers specified, but will
not constrain any unspecified version numbers.\&
.P
\fBbusybox\fR
.RS 4
Installs busybox from the first repository from which it is available.\&
.P
.RE
\fBbusybox@edge\fR
.RS 4
Installs busybox from the first repository tagged "edge" from which
it's available.\& If busybox is \fInot\fR available in repositories with this
tag, it will cause an error.\& When resolving dependencies of tagged
requirements, untagged repositories are preferred, but repositories
sharing the same tag will be considered if necessary.\&
.P
.RE
\fBbusybox=1.\&6.\&1\fR
.RS 4
Install busybox version 1.\&6.\&1.\&
.P
.RE
\fBbusybox>1.\&6.\&1\fR
.RS 4
Install a busybox version greater than 1.\&6.\&1.\&
.P
.RE
\fBbusybox>1.\&6.\&1\fR
.RS 4
Install a busybox version greater than or equal to 1.\&6.\&1.\&
.P
.RE
\fBbusybox<1.\&6.\&1\fR
.RS 4

.P
.RE
\fBbusybox~=1.\&6\fR
.RS 4
