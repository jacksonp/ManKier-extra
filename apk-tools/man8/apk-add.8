.SH NAME
.P
apk add - add packages to \fIworld\fR and commit changes
.P
.SH SYNOPSIS
.P
\fBapk add\fR [<\fIoptions\fR>.\&.\&.\&] \fIpackages\fR.\&.\&.\&
.P
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
\fBapk add\fR adds the requested packages to \fIworld\fR and installs (or upgrades)
them if not already present, ensuring all dependencies are met.\&
.P
To upgrade individual packages without modifying \fIworld\fR use \fBapk-fix\fR(8).\&
.P
By default \fBapk\fR tries to select a set of packages so that all dependencies
are satisfied.\& This means that some packages can be held back in an older
version if there is direct or implicit dependencies to the older version.\&
.P
.SH OPTIONS
.P
\fBapk add\fR supports the commit options described in \fBapk\fR(8), as well as the
following options:
.P
\fB--initdb\fR
.RS 4
Initialize a new package database.\&
.P
.RE
\fB-l, --latest\fR
.RS 4
Always choose the latest package by version.\& However, the versions
considered are based on the package pinning.\& Primarily this overrides
the default heuristic and will cause an error to displayed if all
dependencies cannot be satisfied.\&
.P
.RE
\fB-u, --upgrade\fR
.RS 4
Upgrade \fIpackages\fR and it's dependencies.\& Normally \fBapk add\fR will
avoid changing installed package unless it is required by the newly
added \fIpackages\fR or their dependencies.\& This changes the default
preference to upgrading the package to the latest installable version.\&
.P
.RE
\fB-t, --virtual\fR \fINAME\fR
.RS 4
Create virtual package \fINAME\fR with given dependencies.\& This new package
will get the \fIpackages\fR as dependencies instead of \fIworld\fR.\& Finally the
\fINAME\fR is added to \fIworld\fR.\&
.P
One can use this to ensure that selected set of packages are installed,
and later the temporary modification be undone with \fBapk-del\fR(8) \fINAME\fR
without removing packages that were installed earlier.\&
.P
.RE
\fB--no-chown\fR
.RS 4
Do not change file owner or group.\& By default apk will manage the file
ownership when running as root.\& However, this option is turned on when
running as non-root user, as changing file ownership is not permitted
by the system then.\&
