.P
.SH SYNOPSIS
.P
\fBapk cache\fR [<\fIoptions\fR>.\&.\&.\&] clean

.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
Manage local package cache by removing obsolete packages, or downloading
missing or newer packages from the repositories.\&
.P
\fBapk cache download\fR will fetch package files from the repositories and store
them in the cache, which must be enabled upfront (see \fBapk-cache\fR(5)).\&
.P
\fBapk cache clean\fR will remove package files which are no longer necessary,
having been made obsolete by new versions or no longer being transitively
depended on by packages in \fIworld\fR.\&
.P
\fBapk cache sync\fR performs both operations.\&
.P
.SH OPTIONS
.P
\fB-l, --latest\fR
.RS 4
Always choose the latest package by version.\& However, the versions
considered are based on the package pinning.\& Primarily this overrides
the default heuristic and will cause an error to displayed if all
dependencies cannot be satisfied.\&
.P
.RE
\fB-u, --upgrade\fR
.RS 4
Upgrade \fIpackages\fR and it's dependencies.\& Normally \fBapk add\fR will
avoid changing installed package unless it is required by the newly
added \fIpackages\fR or their dependencies.\& This changes the default
preference to upgrading the package to the latest installable version.\&
