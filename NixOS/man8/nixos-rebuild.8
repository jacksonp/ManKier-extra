.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This command updates the system so that it corresponds to the configuration specified in
/etc/nixos/configuration\&.nix
or
/etc/nixos/flake\&.nix\&. Thus, every time you modify the configuration or any other NixOS module, you must run
\fBnixos\-rebuild\fR
to make the changes take effect\&. It builds the new system in
/nix/store, runs its activation script, and stop and (re)starts any system services if needed\&. Please note that user services need to be started manually as they aren\*(Aqt detected by the activation script at the moment\&.
.PP
This command has one required argument, which specifies the desired operation\&. It must be one of the following:
.PP
\fBswitch\fR
.RS 4
Build and activate the new configuration, and make it the boot default\&. That is, the configuration is added to the GRUB boot menu as the default menu entry, so that subsequent reboots will boot the system into the new configuration\&. Previous configurations activated with
\fBnixos\-rebuild switch\fR
or
\fBnixos\-rebuild boot\fR
remain available in the GRUB menu\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBboot\fR
.RS 4
Build the new configuration and make it the boot default (as with
\fBnixos\-rebuild switch\fR), but do not activate it\&. That is, the system continues to run the previous configuration until the next reboot\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBtest\fR
.RS 4
Build and activate the new configuration, but do not add it to the GRUB boot menu\&. Thus, if you reboot the system (or if it crashes), you will automatically revert to the default configuration (i\&.e\&. the configuration resulting from the last call to
\fBnixos\-rebuild switch\fR
or
\fBnixos\-rebuild boot\fR)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBbuild\fR
.RS 4
Build the new configuration, but neither activate it nor add it to the GRUB boot menu\&. It leaves a symlink named
result
in the current directory, which points to the output of the top\-level \(lqsystem\(rq derivation\&. This is essentially the same as doing
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ nix\-build /path/to/nixpkgs/nixos \-A system
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Note that you do not need to be
root
to run
\fBnixos\-rebuild build\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBdry\-build\fR
.RS 4
Show what store paths would be built or downloaded by any of the operations above, but otherwise do nothing\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBdry\-activate\fR
.RS 4
Build the new configuration, but instead of activating it, show what changes would be performed by the activation (i\&.e\&. by
\fBnixos\-rebuild test\fR)\&. For instance, this command will print which systemd units would be restarted\&. The list of changes is not guaranteed to be complete\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBedit\fR
.RS 4
Opens
configuration\&.nix
in the default editor\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBbuild\-vm\fR
.RS 4
Build a script that starts a NixOS virtual machine with the desired configuration\&. It leaves a symlink
result
in the current directory that points (under
result/bin/run\-\fIhostname\fR\-vm) at the script that starts the VM\&. Thus, to test a NixOS configuration in a virtual machine, you should do the following:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ nixos\-rebuild build\-vm
$ \&./result/bin/run\-*\-vm
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The VM is implemented using the
qemu
package\&. For best performance, you should load the
kvm\-intel
or
kvm\-amd
kernel modules to get hardware virtualisation\&.
.sp
The VM mounts the Nix store of the host through the 9P file system\&. The host Nix store is read\-only, so Nix commands that modify the Nix store will not work in the VM\&. This includes commands such as
\fBnixos\-rebuild\fR; to change the VM\(cqs configuration, you must halt the VM and re\-run the commands above\&.
.sp
The VM has its own
ext3
root file system, which is automatically created when the VM is first started, and is persistent across reboots of the VM\&. It is stored in
\&./\fIhostname\fR\&.qcow2\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBbuild\-vm\-with\-bootloader\fR
.RS 4
Like
\fBbuild\-vm\fR, but boots using the regular boot loader of your configuration (e\&.g\&., GRUB 1 or 2), rather than booting directly into the kernel and initial ramdisk of the system\&. This allows you to test whether the boot loader works correctly\&. However, it does not guarantee that your NixOS configuration will boot successfully on the host hardware (i\&.e\&., after running
\fBnixos\-rebuild switch\fR), because the hardware and boot loader configuration in the VM are different\&. The boot loader is installed on an automatically generated virtual disk containing a
/boot
partition\&.
.RE
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
This command accepts the following options:
.PP
\fB\-\-upgrade\fR, \fB\-\-upgrade\-all\fR
.RS 4
Update the root user\*(Aqs channel named
nixos
before rebuilding the system\&.
.sp
In addition to the
nixos
channel, the root user\*(Aqs channels which have a file named
\&.update\-on\-nixos\-rebuild
in their base directory will also be updated\&.
.sp
Passing
\fB\-\-upgrade\-all\fR
updates all of the root user\*(Aqs channels\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-install\-bootloader\fR
.RS 4
Causes the boot loader to be (re)installed on the device specified by the relevant configuration options\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-no\-build\-nix\fR
.RS 4
Normally,
\fBnixos\-rebuild\fR
first builds the
\fInixUnstable\fR
attribute in Nixpkgs, and uses the resulting instance of the Nix package manager to build the new system configuration\&. This is necessary if the NixOS modules use features not provided by the currently installed version of Nix\&. This option disables building a new Nix\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-fast\fR
.RS 4
Equivalent to
\fB\-\-no\-build\-nix\fR\&. This option is useful if you call
\fBnixos\-rebuild\fR
frequently (e\&.g\&. if you\(cqre hacking on a NixOS module)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-rollback\fR
.RS 4
Instead of building a new configuration as specified by
/etc/nixos/configuration\&.nix, roll back to the previous configuration\&. (The previous configuration is defined as the one before the \(lqcurrent\(rq generation of the Nix profile
/nix/var/nix/profiles/system\&.)
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-builders\fR \fIbuilder\-spec\fR
.RS 4
Allow ad\-hoc remote builders for building the new system\&. This requires the user executing
\fBnixos\-rebuild\fR
(usually root) to be configured as a trusted user in the Nix daemon\&. This can be achieved by using the
nix\&.trustedUsers
NixOS option\&. Examples values for that option are described in the
Remote builds chapter
in the Nix manual, (i\&.e\&.
\fB\-\-builders "ssh://bigbrother x86_64\-linux"\fR)\&. By specifying an empty string existing builders specified in
/etc/nix/machines
can be ignored:
\fB\-\-builders ""\fR
for example when they are not reachable due to network connectivity\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-profile\-name\fR, \fB\-p\fR
.RS 4
Instead of using the Nix profile
/nix/var/nix/profiles/system
to keep track of the current and previous system configurations, use
/nix/var/nix/profiles/system\-profiles/\fIname\fR\&. When you use GRUB 2, for every system profile created with this flag, NixOS will create a submenu named \(lqNixOS \- Profile \*(Aq\fIname\fR\*(Aq\(rq in GRUB\(cqs boot menu, containing the current and previous configurations of this profile\&.
.sp
For instance, if you want to test a configuration file named
test\&.nix
without affecting the default system profile, you would do:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ nixos\-rebuild switch \-p test \-I nixos\-config=\&./test\&.nix
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The new configuration will appear in the GRUB 2 submenu \(lqNixOS \- Profile \*(Aqtest\*(Aq\(rq\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-build\-host\fR
.RS 4
Instead of building the new configuration locally, use the specified host to perform the build\&. The host needs to be accessible with ssh, and must be able to perform Nix builds\&. If the option
\fB\-\-target\-host\fR
is not set, the build will be copied back to the local machine when done\&.
.sp
Note that, if
\fB\-\-no\-build\-nix\fR
is not specified, Nix will be built both locally and remotely\&. This is because the configuration will always be evaluated locally even though the building might be performed remotely\&.
.sp
You can include a remote user name in the host name (\fIuser@host\fR)\&. You can also set ssh options by defining the
\fBNIX_SSHOPTS\fR
environment variable\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-target\-host\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the NixOS target host\&. By setting this to something other than
\fIlocalhost\fR, the system activation will happen on the remote host instead of the local machine\&. The remote host needs to be accessible over ssh, and for the commands
\fBswitch\fR,
\fBboot\fR
and
\fBtest\fR
you need root access\&.
.sp
If
\fB\-\-build\-host\fR
is not explicitly specified, building will take place locally\&.
.sp
You can include a remote user name in the host name (\fIuser@host\fR)\&. You can also set ssh options by defining the
\fBNIX_SSHOPTS\fR
environment variable\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-use\-substitutes\fR
.RS 4
When set, nixos\-rebuild will add
\fB\-\-use\-substitutes\fR
to each invocation of nix\-copy\-closure\&. This will only affect the behavior of nixos\-rebuild if
\fB\-\-target\-host\fR
or
\fB\-\-build\-host\fR
is also set\&. This is useful when the target\-host connection to cache\&.nixos\&.org is faster than the connection between hosts\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-use\-remote\-sudo\fR
.RS 4
When set, nixos\-rebuild prefixes remote commands that run on the
\fB\-\-build\-host\fR
and
\fB\-\-target\-host\fR
systems with
\fBsudo\fR\&. Setting this option allows deploying as a non\-root user\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-flake\fR \fIflake\-uri\fR[#\fIname\fR]
.RS 4
Build the NixOS system from the specified flake\&. It defaults to the directory containing the target of the symlink
/etc/nixos/flake\&.nix, if it exists\&. The flake must contain an output named
nixosConfigurations\&.\fIname\fR\&. If
\fIname\fR
is omitted, it default to the current host name\&.
.RE
.PP
In addition,
\fBnixos\-rebuild\fR
accepts various Nix\-related flags, including
\fB\-\-max\-jobs\fR
/
\fB\-j\fR,
\fB\-\-show\-trace\fR,
\fB\-\-keep\-failed\fR,
\fB\-\-keep\-going\fR,
\fB\-\-impure\fR, and
\fB\-\-verbose\fR
/
\fB\-v\fR\&. See the Nix manual for details\&.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.PP
\fBNIXOS_CONFIG\fR
.RS 4
Path to the main NixOS configuration module\&. Defaults to
/etc/nixos/configuration\&.nix\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBNIX_SSHOPTS\fR
.RS 4
Additional options to be passed to
\fBssh\fR
on the command line\&.
.RE
.SH "FILES"
.PP
/etc/nixos/flake\&.nix
.RS 4
If this file exists, then
\fBnixos\-rebuild\fR
will use it as if the
\fB\-\-flake\fR
option was given\&. This file may be a symlink to a
flake\&.nix
in an actual flake; thus
/etc/nixos
need not be a flake\&.
.RE
.PP
/run/current\-system
.RS 4
A symlink to the currently active system configuration in the Nix store\&.
.RE
.PP
/nix/var/nix/profiles/system
.RS 4
The Nix profile that contains the current and previous system configurations\&. Used to generate the GRUB boot menu\&.
.RE
.SH "BUGS"
.PP
This command should be renamed to something more descriptive\&.
