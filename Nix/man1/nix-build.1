.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBnix\-build\fR
command builds the derivations described by the Nix expressions in
\fIpaths\fR\&. If the build succeeds, it places a symlink to the result in the current directory\&. The symlink is called
result\&. If there are multiple Nix expressions, or the Nix expressions evaluate to multiple derivations, multiple sequentially numbered symlinks are created (result,
result\-2, and so on)\&.
.PP
If no
\fIpaths\fR
are specified, then
\fBnix\-build\fR
will use
default\&.nix
in the current directory, if it exists\&.
.PP
If an element of
\fIpaths\fR
starts with
http://
or
https://, it is interpreted as the URL of a tarball that will be downloaded and unpacked to a temporary location\&. The tarball must include a single top\-level directory containing at least a file named
default\&.nix\&.
.PP
\fBnix\-build\fR
is essentially a wrapper around
\fBnix\-instantiate\fR
(to translate a high\-level Nix expression to a low\-level store derivation) and
\fBnix\-store \-\-realise\fR
(to build the store derivation)\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
All options not listed here are passed to
\fBnix\-store \-\-realise\fR, except for
\fB\-\-arg\fR
and
\fB\-\-attr\fR
/
\fB\-A\fR
which are passed to
\fBnix\-instantiate\fR\&.
.PP
\fB\-\-no\-out\-link\fR
.RS 4
Do not create a symlink to the output path\&. Note that as a result the output does not become a root of the garbage collector, and so might be deleted by
\fBnix\-store \-\-gc\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-out\-link\fR / \fB\-o\fR \fIoutlink\fR
.RS 4
Change the name of the symlink to the output path created from
result
to
\fIoutlink\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
The following common options are supported:
.PP
\fB\-\-help\fR
.RS 4
Prints out a summary of the command syntax and exits\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-version\fR
.RS 4
Prints out the Nix version number on standard output and exits\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-verbose\fR / \fB\-v\fR
.RS 4
Increases the level of verbosity of diagnostic messages printed on standard error\&. For each Nix operation, the information printed on standard output is well\-defined; any diagnostic information is printed on standard error, never on standard output\&.
.sp
This option may be specified repeatedly\&. Currently, the following verbosity levels exist:
.PP

.RS 4
\(lqErrors only\(rq: only print messages explaining why the Nix invocation failed\&.
.RE

.RE
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-quiet\fR
.RS 4
Decreases the level of verbosity of diagnostic messages printed on standard error\&. This is the inverse option to
\fB\-v\fR
/
\fB\-\-verbose\fR\&.
.sp
This option may be specified repeatedly\&. See the previous verbosity levels list\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-no\-build\-output\fR / \fB\-Q\fR
.RS 4
By default, output written by builders to standard output and standard error is echoed to the Nix command\*(Aqs standard error\&. This option suppresses this behaviour\&. Note that the builder\*(Aqs standard output and error are always written to a log file in
\fIprefix\fR/nix/var/log/nix\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-max\-jobs\fR / \fB\-j\fR \fInumber\fR
.RS 4
Sets the maximum number of build jobs that Nix will perform in parallel to the specified number\&. Specify
auto
to use the number of CPUs in the system\&. The default is specified by the
max\-jobs
configuration setting, which itself defaults to
1\&. A higher value is useful on SMP systems or to exploit I/O latency\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-cores\fR
.RS 4
Sets the value of the
\fBNIX_BUILD_CORES\fR
environment variable in the invocation of builders\&. Builders can use this variable at their discretion to control the maximum amount of parallelism\&. For instance, in Nixpkgs, if the derivation attribute
\fIenableParallelBuilding\fR
is set to
true, the builder passes the
\fB\-j\fR\fB\fIN\fR\fR
flag to GNU Make\&. It defaults to the value of the
cores
configuration setting, if set, or
1
otherwise\&. The value
0
means that the builder should use all available CPU cores in the system\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-max\-silent\-time\fR
.RS 4
Sets the maximum number of seconds that a builder can go without producing any data on standard output or standard error\&. The default is specified by the
max\-silent\-time
configuration setting\&.
0
means no time\-out\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-timeout\fR
.RS 4
Sets the maximum number of seconds that a builder can run\&. The default is specified by the
timeout
configuration setting\&.
0
means no timeout\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-keep\-going\fR / \fB\-k\fR
.RS 4
Keep going in case of failed builds, to the greatest extent possible\&. That is, if building an input of some derivation fails, Nix will still build the other inputs, but not the derivation itself\&. Without this option, Nix stops if any build fails (except for builds of substitutes), possibly killing builds in progress (in case of parallel or distributed builds)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-keep\-failed\fR / \fB\-K\fR
.RS 4
Specifies that in case of a build failure, the temporary directory (usually in
/tmp) in which the build takes place should not be deleted\&. The path of the build directory is printed as an informational message\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-fallback\fR
.RS 4
Whenever Nix attempts to build a derivation for which substitutes are known for each output path, but realising the output paths through the substitutes fails, fall back on building the derivation\&.
.sp
The most common scenario in which this is useful is when we have registered substitutes in order to perform binary distribution from, say, a network repository\&. If the repository is down, the realisation of the derivation will fail\&. When this option is specified, Nix will build the derivation instead\&. Thus, installation from binaries falls back on installation from source\&. This option is not the default since it is generally not desirable for a transient failure in obtaining the substitutes to lead to a full build from source (with the related consumption of resources)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-no\-build\-hook\fR
.RS 4
Disables the build hook mechanism\&. This allows to ignore remote builders if they are setup on the machine\&.
.sp
It\*(Aqs useful in cases where the bandwidth between the client and the remote builder is too low\&. In that case it can take more time to upload the sources to the remote builder and fetch back the result than to do the computation locally\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-readonly\-mode\fR
.RS 4
When this option is used, no attempt is made to open the Nix database\&. Most Nix operations do need database access, so those operations will fail\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-arg\fR \fIname\fR \fIvalue\fR
.RS 4
This option is accepted by
\fBnix\-env\fR,
\fBnix\-instantiate\fR
and
\fBnix\-build\fR\&. When evaluating Nix expressions, the expression evaluator will automatically try to call functions that it encounters\&. It can automatically call functions for which every argument has a
default value
(e\&.g\&.,
{ \fIargName\fR ? \fIdefaultValue\fR }: \fI\&.\&.\&.\fR)\&. With
\fB\-\-arg\fR, you can also call functions that have arguments without a default value (or override a default value)\&. That is, if the evaluator encounters a function with an argument named
\fIname\fR, it will call it with value
\fIvalue\fR\&.
.sp
For instance, the top\-level
default\&.nix
in Nixpkgs is actually a function:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
{ # The system (e\&.g\&., `i686\-linux\*(Aq) for which to build the packages\&.
  system ? builtins\&.currentSystem
  \fI\&.\&.\&.\fR
}: \fI\&.\&.\&.\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
So if you call this Nix expression (e\&.g\&., when you do
nix\-env \-i \fIpkgname\fR), the function will be called automatically using the value
builtins\&.currentSystem
for the
system
argument\&. You can override this using
\fB\-\-arg\fR, e\&.g\&.,
nix\-env \-i \fIpkgname\fR \-\-arg system \e"i686\-freebsd\e"\&. (Note that since the argument is a Nix string literal, you have to escape the quotes\&.)
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-argstr\fR \fIname\fR \fIvalue\fR
.RS 4
This option is like
\fB\-\-arg\fR, only the value is not a Nix expression but a string\&. So instead of
\-\-arg system \e"i686\-linux\e"
(the outer quotes are to keep the shell happy) you can say
\-\-argstr system i686\-linux\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-attr\fR / \fB\-A\fR \fIattrPath\fR
.RS 4
Select an attribute from the top\-level Nix expression being evaluated\&. (\fBnix\-env\fR,
\fBnix\-instantiate\fR,
\fBnix\-build\fR
and
\fBnix\-shell\fR
only\&.) The
\fIattribute path\fR
\fIattrPath\fR
is a sequence of attribute names separated by dots\&. For instance, given a top\-level Nix expression
\fIe\fR, the attribute path
xorg\&.xorgserver
would cause the expression
\fIe\fR\&.xorg\&.xorgserver
to be used\&. See
\fBnix\-env \-\-install\fR
for some concrete examples\&.
.sp
In addition to attribute names, you can also specify array indices\&. For instance, the attribute path
foo\&.3\&.bar
selects the
bar
attribute of the fourth element of the array in the
foo
attribute of the top\-level expression\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-expr\fR / \fB\-E\fR
.RS 4
Interpret the command line arguments as a list of Nix expressions to be parsed and evaluated, rather than as a list of file names of Nix expressions\&. (\fBnix\-instantiate\fR,
\fBnix\-build\fR
and
\fBnix\-shell\fR
only\&.)
.RE
.PP
\fB\-I\fR \fIpath\fR
.RS 4
Add a path to the Nix expression search path\&. This option may be given multiple times\&. See the
\fBNIX_PATH\fR
environment variable for information on the semantics of the Nix search path\&. Paths added through
\fB\-I\fR
take precedence over
\fBNIX_PATH\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-option\fR \fIname\fR \fIvalue\fR
.RS 4
Set the Nix configuration option
\fIname\fR
to
\fIvalue\fR\&. This overrides settings in the Nix configuration file (see
\fBnix.conf\fR(5))\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-repair\fR
.RS 4
Fix corrupted or missing store paths by redownloading or rebuilding them\&. Note that this is slow because it requires computing a cryptographic hash of the contents of every path in the closure of the build\&. Also note the warning under
\fBnix\-store \-\-repair\-path\fR\&.

result,
result\-bin

\fBNIX_PATH\fR
.RS 4
A colon\-separated list of directories used to look up Nix expressions enclosed in angle brackets (i\&.e\&.,

.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
/home/eelco/Dev:/etc/nixos
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
will cause Nix to look for paths relative to
/home/eelco/Dev
and
/etc/nixos, in that order\&. It is also possible to match paths against a prefix\&. For example, the value
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
nixpkgs=/home/eelco/Dev/nixpkgs\-branch:/etc/nixos
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE

<nixpkgs/\fIpath\fR>
in
/home/eelco/Dev/nixpkgs\-branch/\fIpath\fR
and
/etc/nixos/nixpkgs/\fIpath\fR\&.
.sp
If a path in the Nix search path starts with
http://
or
https://, it is interpreted as the URL of a tarball that will be downloaded and unpacked to a temporary location\&. The tarball must consist of a single top\-level directory\&. For example, setting
\fBNIX_PATH\fR
to
.sp
.if n \{\

.nf
nixpkgs=https://github\&.com/NixOS/nixpkgs\-channels/archive/nixos\-15\&.09\&.tar\&.gz
.fi
.if n \{\

.nf
nixpkgs=channel:nixos\-15\&.09

.RE
.PP
\fBNIX_IGNORE_SYMLINK_STORE\fR
.RS 4
Normally, the Nix store directory (typically
/nix/store) is not allowed to contain any symlink components\&. This is to prevent \(lqimpure\(rq builds\&. Builders sometimes \(lqcanonicalise\(rq paths by resolving all symlink components\&. Thus, builds on different machines (with
/nix/store
resolving to different locations) could yield different results\&. This is generally not a problem, except when builds are deployed to machines where
/nix/store
resolves differently\&. If you are sure that you\(cqre not going to do that, you can set
\fBNIX_IGNORE_SYMLINK_STORE\fR
to
\fB1\fR\&.
.sp
Note that if you\(cqre symlinking the Nix store so that you can put it on another file system than the root file system, on Linux you\(cqre better off using
bind
mount points, e\&.g\&.,
