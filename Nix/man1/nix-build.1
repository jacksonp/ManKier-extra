.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBnix\-build\fR
command builds the derivations described by the Nix expressions in
\fIpaths\fR\&. If the build succeeds, it places a symlink to the result in the current directory\&. The symlink is called
result\&. If there are multiple Nix expressions, or the Nix expressions evaluate to multiple derivations, multiple sequentially numbered symlinks are created (result,
result\-2, and so on)\&.
.PP
If no
\fIpaths\fR
are specified, then
\fBnix\-build\fR
will use
default\&.nix
in the current directory, if it exists\&.
.PP
If an element of
\fIpaths\fR
starts with
http://
or
https://, it is interpreted as the URL of a tarball that will be downloaded and unpacked to a temporary location\&. The tarball must include a single top\-level directory containing at least a file named
default\&.nix\&.
.PP
\fBnix\-build\fR
is essentially a wrapper around
\fBnix\-instantiate\fR
(to translate a high\-level Nix expression to a low\-level store derivation) and
\fBnix\-store \-\-realise\fR
(to build the store derivation)\&.

All options not listed here are passed to
\fBnix\-store \-\-realise\fR, except for
\fB\-\-arg\fR
and
\fB\-\-attr\fR
/
\fB\-A\fR
which are passed to
\fBnix\-instantiate\fR\&.
.PP
\fB\-\-no\-out\-link\fR
.RS 4
Do not create a symlink to the output path\&. Note that as a result the output does not become a root of the garbage collector, and so might be deleted by
\fBnix\-store \-\-gc\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-dry\-run\fR

.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-out\-link\fR / \fB\-o\fR \fIoutlink\fR

\fIoutlink\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
The following common options are supported:
.PP
\fB\-\-help\fR
.RS 4
Prints out a summary of the command syntax and exits\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-version\fR
.RS 4
Prints out the Nix version number on standard output and exits\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-verbose\fR / \fB\-v\fR
.RS 4
Increases the level of verbosity of diagnostic messages printed on standard error\&. For each Nix operation, the information printed on standard output is well\-defined; any diagnostic information is printed on standard error, never on standard output\&.
.sp
This option may be specified repeatedly\&. Currently, the following verbosity levels exist:
.PP

.RS 4
\(lqErrors only\(rq: only print messages explaining why the Nix invocation failed\&.
.RE

.RE
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-quiet\fR
.RS 4
Decreases the level of verbosity of diagnostic messages printed on standard error\&. This is the inverse option to
\fB\-v\fR
/
\fB\-\-verbose\fR\&.
.sp
This option may be specified repeatedly\&. See the previous verbosity levels list\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-no\-build\-output\fR / \fB\-Q\fR
.RS 4
By default, output written by builders to standard output and standard error is echoed to the Nix command\*(Aqs standard error\&. This option suppresses this behaviour\&. Note that the builder\*(Aqs standard output and error are always written to a log file in
\fIprefix\fR/nix/var/log/nix\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-max\-jobs\fR / \fB\-j\fR \fInumber\fR
.RS 4
Sets the maximum number of build jobs that Nix will perform in parallel to the specified number\&. Specify
auto
to use the number of CPUs in the system\&. The default is specified by the
max\-jobs
configuration setting, which itself defaults to
1\&. A higher value is useful on SMP systems or to exploit I/O latency\&.
.sp
Setting it to
0
disallows building on the local machine, which is useful when you want builds to happen only on remote builders\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-cores\fR
.RS 4
Sets the value of the
\fBNIX_BUILD_CORES\fR
environment variable in the invocation of builders\&. Builders can use this variable at their discretion to control the maximum amount of parallelism\&. For instance, in Nixpkgs, if the derivation attribute
\fIenableParallelBuilding\fR
is set to
true, the builder passes the
\fB\-j\fR\fB\fIN\fR\fR
flag to GNU Make\&. It defaults to the value of the
cores
configuration setting, if set, or
1
otherwise\&. The value
0
means that the builder should use all available CPU cores in the system\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-max\-silent\-time\fR
.RS 4
Sets the maximum number of seconds that a builder can go without producing any data on standard output or standard error\&. The default is specified by the
max\-silent\-time
configuration setting\&.
0
means no time\-out\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-timeout\fR
.RS 4
Sets the maximum number of seconds that a builder can run\&. The default is specified by the
timeout
configuration setting\&.
0
means no timeout\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-keep\-going\fR / \fB\-k\fR
.RS 4
Keep going in case of failed builds, to the greatest extent possible\&. That is, if building an input of some derivation fails, Nix will still build the other inputs, but not the derivation itself\&. Without this option, Nix stops if any build fails (except for builds of substitutes), possibly killing builds in progress (in case of parallel or distributed builds)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-keep\-failed\fR / \fB\-K\fR
.RS 4
Specifies that in case of a build failure, the temporary directory (usually in
/tmp) in which the build takes place should not be deleted\&. The path of the build directory is printed as an informational message\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-fallback\fR
.RS 4
Whenever Nix attempts to build a derivation for which substitutes are known for each output path, but realising the output paths through the substitutes fails, fall back on building the derivation\&.
.sp
The most common scenario in which this is useful is when we have registered substitutes in order to perform binary distribution from, say, a network repository\&. If the repository is down, the realisation of the derivation will fail\&. When this option is specified, Nix will build the derivation instead\&. Thus, installation from binaries falls back on installation from source\&. This option is not the default since it is generally not desirable for a transient failure in obtaining the substitutes to lead to a full build from source (with the related consumption of resources)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-no\-build\-hook\fR
.RS 4
Disables the build hook mechanism\&. This allows to ignore remote builders if they are setup on the machine\&.
.sp
It\*(Aqs useful in cases where the bandwidth between the client and the remote builder is too low\&. In that case it can take more time to upload the sources to the remote builder and fetch back the result than to do the computation locally\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-readonly\-mode\fR
.RS 4
When this option is used, no attempt is made to open the Nix database\&. Most Nix operations do need database access, so those operations will fail\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-arg\fR \fIname\fR \fIvalue\fR
.RS 4
This option is accepted by
\fBnix\-env\fR,
\fBnix\-instantiate\fR
and
\fBnix\-build\fR\&. When evaluating Nix expressions, the expression evaluator will automatically try to call functions that it encounters\&. It can automatically call functions for which every argument has a
default value
(e\&.g\&.,
{ \fIargName\fR ? \fIdefaultValue\fR }: \fI\&.\&.\&.\fR)\&. With
\fB\-\-arg\fR, you can also call functions that have arguments without a default value (or override a default value)\&. That is, if the evaluator encounters a function with an argument named
\fIname\fR, it will call it with value
\fIvalue\fR\&.
.sp
For instance, the top\-level
default\&.nix
in Nixpkgs is actually a function:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
{ # The system (e\&.g\&., `i686\-linux\*(Aq) for which to build the packages\&.
  system ? builtins\&.currentSystem
  \fI\&.\&.\&.\fR
}: \fI\&.\&.\&.\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
So if you call this Nix expression (e\&.g\&., when you do
nix\-env \-i \fIpkgname\fR), the function will be called automatically using the value
builtins\&.currentSystem
for the
system
argument\&. You can override this using
\fB\-\-arg\fR, e\&.g\&.,
nix\-env \-i \fIpkgname\fR \-\-arg system \e"i686\-freebsd\e"\&. (Note that since the argument is a Nix string literal, you have to escape the quotes\&.)
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-argstr\fR \fIname\fR \fIvalue\fR
.RS 4
This option is like
\fB\-\-arg\fR, only the value is not a Nix expression but a string\&. So instead of
\-\-arg system \e"i686\-linux\e"
(the outer quotes are to keep the shell happy) you can say
\-\-argstr system i686\-linux\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-attr\fR / \fB\-A\fR \fIattrPath\fR
.RS 4
Select an attribute from the top\-level Nix expression being evaluated\&. (\fBnix\-env\fR,
\fBnix\-instantiate\fR,
\fBnix\-build\fR
and
\fBnix\-shell\fR
only\&.) The
\fIattribute path\fR
\fIattrPath\fR
is a sequence of attribute names separated by dots\&. For instance, given a top\-level Nix expression
\fIe\fR, the attribute path
xorg\&.xorgserver
would cause the expression
\fIe\fR\&.xorg\&.xorgserver
to be used\&. See
\fBnix\-env \-\-install\fR
for some concrete examples\&.
.sp
In addition to attribute names, you can also specify array indices\&. For instance, the attribute path
foo\&.3\&.bar
selects the
bar
attribute of the fourth element of the array in the
foo
attribute of the top\-level expression\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-expr\fR / \fB\-E\fR
.RS 4
Interpret the command line arguments as a list of Nix expressions to be parsed and evaluated, rather than as a list of file names of Nix expressions\&. (\fBnix\-instantiate\fR,
\fBnix\-build\fR
and
\fBnix\-shell\fR
only\&.)
.RE
.PP
\fB\-I\fR \fIpath\fR
.RS 4
Add a path to the Nix expression search path\&. This option may be given multiple times\&. See the
\fBNIX_PATH\fR
environment variable for information on the semantics of the Nix search path\&. Paths added through
\fB\-I\fR
take precedence over
\fBNIX_PATH\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-option\fR \fIname\fR \fIvalue\fR
.RS 4
Set the Nix configuration option
\fIname\fR
to
\fIvalue\fR\&. This overrides settings in the Nix configuration file (see
\fBnix.conf\fR(5))\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-repair\fR
.RS 4
Fix corrupted or missing store paths by redownloading or rebuilding them\&. Note that this is slow because it requires computing a cryptographic hash of the contents of every path in the closure of the build\&. Also note the warning under
\fBnix\-store \-\-repair\-path\fR\&.

\fBNIX_PATH\fR
.RS 4
A colon\-separated list of directories used to look up Nix expressions enclosed in angle brackets (i\&.e\&.,

.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
/home/eelco/Dev:/etc/nixos
.fi
.if n \{\

.sp
will cause Nix to look for paths relative to
/home/eelco/Dev
and
/etc/nixos, in that order\&. It is also possible to match paths against a prefix\&. For example, the value
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
nixpkgs=/home/eelco/Dev/nixpkgs\-branch:/etc/nixos
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE

<nixpkgs/\fIpath\fR>
in
/home/eelco/Dev/nixpkgs\-branch/\fIpath\fR

/etc/nixos/nixpkgs/\fIpath\fR\&.
.sp
If a path in the Nix search path starts with
http://
or
https://, it is interpreted as the URL of a tarball that will be downloaded and unpacked to a temporary location\&. The tarball must consist of a single top\-level directory\&. For example, setting
\fBNIX_PATH\fR

.PP
\fBNIX_IGNORE_SYMLINK_STORE\fR
.RS 4
Normally, the Nix store directory (typically
/nix/store) is not allowed to contain any symlink components\&. This is to prevent \(lqimpure\(rq builds\&. Builders sometimes \(lqcanonicalise\(rq paths by resolving all symlink components\&. Thus, builds on different machines (with
/nix/store
resolving to different locations) could yield different results\&. This is generally not a problem, except when builds are deployed to machines where
/nix/store
resolves differently\&. If you are sure that you\(cqre not going to do that, you can set
\fBNIX_IGNORE_SYMLINK_STORE\fR
to
\fB1\fR\&.
.sp
Note that if you\(cqre symlinking the Nix store so that you can put it on another file system than the root file system, on Linux you\(cqre better off using
