yum \- Yellowdog Updater Modified shell
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fByum shell\fP [filename]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP 
\fByum\fP includes an interactive shell for conducting multiple commands or
sets of commands during a single execution of yum. These commands can be
issued manually or passed to yum from a file. The commands are much the same
as the normal yum command line options. See here \fIyum(8)\fP for that
information. There are a few additional commands documented below.

.PP
.IP "\fBconfig\fP"
   [argument] [value] 
   args: debuglevel, errorlevel, obsoletes, gpgcheck, assumeyes, exclude
     If no value is given it prints the current value\&. 
     If value is given it sets that value\&.
.IP
.IP "\fBrepo\fP"
   [argument] [option]
     list: lists repositories and their status
     enable: enable repositories. option = repository id 
     disable: disable repositories. option = repository id 
.IP
.IP "\fBtransaction\fP"
   [argument]
     list: lists the contents of the transaction 
     reset: reset (zero-out) the transaction 
     solve: run the dependency solver on the transaction
     run: run the transaction 
.IP
.IP "\fBexit\fP"
     Causes the shell to exit, setting the exit status as specified by the
     \fBshell_exit_status\fR option in \fIyum.conf(5)\fR.
     This command is also triggered when EOF is read (usually the C-d keystroke
     or end of script).

.PP 
.SH "Examples"
The following are examples of using the yum shell\&.
.IP
 list available packagename*
 groupinfo 'Some Group'
 install foo
 remove bar
 update baz
 run

That will list available packages matching the glob 'packagename*'.
It will return information on the group 'Some Group'
It will then queue the following commands into  the transaction: install
foo, remove bar, update baz. Then the 'run' command will resolve dependencies
for the transaction commands and run the transaction.
