yum-cron \- an interface to conveniently call yum from cron

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fByum-cron\fP [config-file]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP 
\fByum-cron\fP is an alternate interface to yum that is optimised to
be convenient to call from cron.  It provides methods to keep
repository metadata up to date, and to check for, download, and apply
updates.  Rather than accepting many different command line arguments,
the different functions of yum-cron can be accessed through config
files.
.PP 
\fIconfig-file\fP is used to optionally specify the path to the
configuration file to use.  If it is not given, the default
configuration file will be used.  It is useful to be able to specify
different configuration files for different use cases.  For example,
one configuration file might be set to update the repository metadata,
and a line could be added to the crontab to run yum-cron frequently
using this file.  Then, another configuration file might be set to
install updates, and yum-cron could be run from cron using this file
just once each day.
